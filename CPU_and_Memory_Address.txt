0x00000000 = 0 
0xFFFFFFFF = 


2^32 = 4,294,967,296 different values (different memory addresses (each a byte)) (4gb total memory supported)

2^64 = ... allot



The address buss with (32 or 64 bit usuall) controls the possible addresses that can be accessed by the CPU

data buss can be smaller, requring more cycles to process bigger data
... like if you had 8 bit data buss it would take 2 cycles to process 16 bits

data that doesn't fit the bus will need to have an extra cycle. (so try to write instructions that are equal to the architecture)


Address bus tells the data where to go

data buss supplies the data



CPU's with allot of vacan addresses will inevitablly have empty
